\hypertarget{data_dist_data_dist1}{}\section{\char`\"{}\+Panel\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}full\char`\"{} data storage}\label{data_dist_data_dist1}
We have to deal with big arrays (matching coefficients, eigen vectors, wave functions, etc.) which may not fit into the memory of a single node. For some operations we need a \char`\"{}panel\char`\"{} distribution of data, where each M\+P\+I rank gets a local panel of block-\/cyclic distributed matrix. This way of storing data is necessary for the distributed P\+B\+L\+A\+S and Sca\+L\+A\+P\+A\+C\+K operations.
