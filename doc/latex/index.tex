S\+I\+R\+I\+U\+S is a domain-\/specific library for electronic structure calculations. It supports full-\/potential linearized augmented plane wave (F\+P-\/\+L\+A\+P\+W) and pseudopotential plane wave (P\+P-\/\+P\+W) methods and is designed to work with codes such as Exciting, Elk, Quantum E\+S\+P\+R\+E\+S\+S\+O, etc. \hypertarget{index_install}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install}
