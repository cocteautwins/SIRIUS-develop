Below is the list of standard names for some of the loop variables\+:

l -\/ index of orbital quantum number ~\newline
m -\/ index of azimutal quantum nuber ~\newline
lm -\/ combined index of (l,m) quantum numbers ~\newline
ia -\/ index of atom ~\newline
ic -\/ index of atom class ~\newline
iat -\/ index of atom type ~\newline
ir -\/ index of r-\/point ~\newline
ig -\/ index of G-\/vector ~\newline
idxlo -\/ index of local orbital ~\newline
idxrf -\/ index of radial function ~\newline
xi -\/ compbined index of lm and idxrf (product of angular and radial functions) ~\newline
ik -\/ index of k-\/point ~\newline
itp -\/ index of (theta, phi) spherical angles ~\newline
 The \+\_\+loc suffix is often added to the variables to indicate that they represent the local fraction of the elements assigned to the given M\+P\+I rank.
